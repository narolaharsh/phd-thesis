While I cannot possibly thank everyone for everything that has made this journey possible, I will still attempt. 

I want to start by thanking my promoter, Chris. I am thankful for the freedom you gave me during the first half of my PhD, which allowed me to work on a variety of topics. I want to thank you for teaching me how to take criticism and think objectively about my work, especially in the latter half. I must also thank you since it would have taken me a few more years to discover Westmalle Tripel if it weren't for you.  

I want to thank my co-promoter, Anuradha. Some of our earlier discussions inspired me to think about glitches in the Einstein Telescope era. I am grateful for your support when working within the large collaborations. I also want to thank you for taking the time to hear me complain. 

I want to thank the admins of the Stoomboot cluster at Nikhef. I want to thank Monique and Marie-Thérèse at GRASP and the admins at the international service desk at Utrecht University. 

My master's thesis advisors, Soumen and Anand, deserve many thanks for getting me started on this topic. I appreciate the support from the collaborators in Leuven. Tjonnie, thank you for your insights on various occasions and for reminding me to slow down every time I feel like I am talking too slowly. I am thankful to Otto and the colleagues in Hong Kong.   

I want to thank my colleagues at GRASP: Sumit, Mick, Fabian, Haris, Martin, Luca, Olaf, Johanna, Gijs, Quirijn, Justus, Nick, Rick, Noor, Suzanne, Rene, Marcel, Marta, Alessandro, Thomas, and Raimond. I thank Tomek for cakes and cookies, Anna for making the time to stay in touch, Stefano for the promises to stay in touch, Justin for the travels to conferences, and Bas for the good vibes. Thibeau and Peter, I look forward to working with you and more importantly to our next visit to the dim sum restaurant. Tom, I value our friendship and our collaboration. Marc, it was a pleasure sharing the office with you until you abandoned me. 

I want to thank my friends in Utrecht: Anam, Rajat, Melissa, Antoni, Anushree, and Shridhar. I want to thank Marijn for facing all the headwind on our biking trips. My former landlords and landladies around Utrecht have been a part of this adventure. Without their interventions, I might have completed my PhD a few months earlier. 

I am indebted to my parents, big brother, and sister-in-law. I thank Suze's family for making me feel at home and Suze for her love.
