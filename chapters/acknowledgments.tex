I want to begin by thanking my promoter, Chris. I am grateful for the freedom you gave me in the first half of my PhD, allowing me to work on a variety of topics. I want to thank you for teaching me how to take criticism and to think objectively of my own work, especially in the latter half of my PhD. I must also thank you since it would have taken me a few more years to discover Westmall Tripel if it weren't for you.  

I want to thank my co-promoter, Anuradha. Some of our earlier discussions inspired me to think about glitches in the Einstein Telescope era. I am grateful for the support you provided when working within the large collaborations and I also want to thank you for making the time to hear me complain. 

My master's thesis advisors, Soumen Roy and Anand Sengupta, deserve many thanks for getting me started on this topic. Tjonnie, I want to thank you for our discussions on various occasions and for reminding me to slow down every time I felt like I was talking too slow. Marc, it was a pleasure to share the office with you until you moved to the other side. 

I am grateful to the colleagues at Utrecht and Nikhef: Sumit, Mick, Fabian, Otto, Haris, Chinmay, Bhooshan, Olaf, Gijs, Quirijn, Johanna, Justus, Luca, Nick, Rick, Pooya, and Noor. Tomek, you have been a great friend. Thank you for helping me pay my first month's rent when I didn't yet have a Dutch bank account. I want to thank Anna for making the time to stay in touch, Stefano for the promises to stay in touch, Justin for being a great travel buddy, and Bas for the good vibes. Thibeau and Peter, I look forward to working with you and, more importantly, to our next visit to the dim sum restaurant. Tom, I value our friendship as much as our collaboration, from which I have been learning a great deal about machine learning. 

I thank the administrators of stoomboot computing cluster at Nikhef. Without these computing facilities, I would not have completed my PhD in time. I thank the GRASP secretaries, Monique and Marie-Thérèse, as well as the staff at international service desk at Utrecht University. My former landlords and landladies around Utrecht have also been a part of this adventure. If it weren't for your interventions, I might have completed my PhD a few months earlier.  

I want to thank my friends Anam, Rajat, Melissa, Antoni, Anushree, Aayush, and Shridhar. I want to thank Marijn for taking all the headwind when our biking trips. 

I am indebted to my parents, my brother, and sister-in-law. I thank Suze's family for making me feel home and Suze for her love.
