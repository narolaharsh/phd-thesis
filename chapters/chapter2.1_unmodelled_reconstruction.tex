\begin{itemize}
    \item What is meant by generic excess power? What can cause it? unmodelled signals, glitches, signals overlapping glitches
    \item Transdimensional sampling and RJMCMC
    \item BayesWave: Morlet Gabour wavelet. Q-scan and bayeswave reconstruction
\end{itemize}

Paragraph 1: What is generic excess power? What can cause it (glitches mainly)? 
Paragraph 2: Why it is important to be able to reconstruct generic excess power? Removing glitches, glitches overlapping signal, searches for echoes, supernovae, test of GR, estimating Power Spectral Density
