What do I want to explain in this chapter?
Geodesic equation - field equations - linearising them - gravitational waves plus and cross - generation of GW - effect on matter - detectors 

To detect them, we use Michaelson-Morley interferometer. It is an L-shaped infrastructure with two arms of equal length. Laser bounces off of the mirrors located at the end each arms. If detectors encounters a GW signal, the arm length changes which gives rise to a constructive and destructive interference pattern. That helps us measure a GW signal.

It is intuitive to think that if this thesis is dropped from the top of a tall building and if the earth's gravity is the only force acting on it, it will travel in a straight line. This trajectory can be determined using Newton's laws of motion~\cite{Newton:1687eqk}. The trajectory is also unique in the sense that it traces the shortest path between the start and end points in a flat space such as the one we are in (i.e. where the gravity is weak). The notion of straight lines in flat spaces can be generalized using geodesics, which marks the shortest path between any two points in spaces with arbitrary curvature. For example, the geodesic between any two points on a spherical surface will trace the great circle passing through the two points. 

\subsubsection{Geodesics}
In practice, the shortest path between two points in curved space is obtained by solving the geodesic equation
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:geodesic}
    \frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0,
\end{equation}    
where $\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}$ are called Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\tau$ is the scalar parameter of motion also known as proper time. The indices $\mu, \alpha, \beta$ vary from 0 to 3. If an index repeats on the same side of the equal sign, it is summed over (Einstein's summation convention). 

Intuitively, $\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}$ encodes the notion of force (e.g. gravity) of the Newtonian dynamics\footnote{When writing down axioms of motion initially, Newton struggled to settle on the word force, considering alternatives such as power, efficacy, vigor, strength, or virtue~\cite{gleick2003isaac}.}. For example, when an inertial frame of an object is described using cartesian coordinate system, $\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}$ will be zero everywhere. Therefore, Eq.~\eqref{eq:geodesic} reduces to Newton's second law of motion in the absence of any external force, $\ddot{x} = 0$. 

\section{Einstein field equation}
While Newton's theory of gravity attempts to quantify the gravitational force exerted by one body onto another, the explanation on what causes such a force was delibarately left to future work. The general relativity refines the notion of gravitational force by establishing it as an effect caused by a massive object by curving the space around it~\cite{origin:gr}. In the form of Einstein field equation, general relativity relates the distribution of matter to the curvature the space-time continuum (also referred to as spacetime),
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:field_eq}
    G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where Einstein tensor $G_{\mu\nu}$ encodes the information about the curvature and distribution of matter is encoded in the stress-energy tensor~$T_{\mu\nu}$. We use geometric units therefore the speed of light and universal gravitational constant in Eq.~\eqref{eq:field_eq} are set to unity. 
\subsubsection{Definitions}
The Einstein tensor $G_{\mu\nu}$ is defined using Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$, the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$, and the contraction $R = g^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}$ called Ricci scalar,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:einstein_tensor_ricci}
    G_{\mu\nu} \equiv R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu} R,
\end{equation}
Ricci tensor is defined using contraction of Riemann tensor, 
\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} = R^{\lambda}_{~\mu\lambda\nu}.
\end{equation}
The raising or lower of an index is done using the metric tensor, i.e., $R^{\rho}_{~\mu\lambda\nu} = g^{\rho\alpha}R_{\alpha\mu\lambda\nu}$. Riemann tensor is derived using Christoffel symbols,
\begin{equation}
    R^{\rho}_{\ \mu\lambda\nu} = \partial_\lambda \Gamma^{\rho}_{\nu\mu} - \partial_\nu \Gamma^{\rho}_{\lambda\mu} + \Gamma^{\rho}_{\lambda\sigma} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu\mu} - \Gamma^{\rho}_{\nu\sigma} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\lambda\mu}.
\end{equation}
The Christoffel symbol is derived using the partial derivatives of metric tensor,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:christoffel_symbols}
    \Gamma^{\rho}_{\nu\mu} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\rho\sigma} \left( \partial_\nu g_{\mu\sigma} + \partial_\mu g_{\nu\sigma} - \partial_\sigma g_{\nu\mu} \right).
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Interpretation}
Intuitively, the metric tensor introduces the notion of distance and angles on an arbitrary surface. Christoffel symbols use metric tensor to track how vectors change when transported parallelly. Riemann tensor (also known as curvature tensor) uses Christoffel symbols to determine how tensors changes when trasnported on a closed path, which helps determine curvature. For a flat surface they do not change, so the curvature is zero. Finally, Ricci tensor specifically determines how volumes change on such path. While I find such physical interpretation of the quantities helpful, I do not claim it to capture the essence of the formal definitions~\cite{Misner:1973prb}.  

The Einstein field Eq.~\eqref{eq:field_eq} can be thought of as an equation of the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$, an unknown obtained by solving the equation for a given distribution of matter. Despite the apparent simplicity of Eq.~\eqref{eq:field_eq}, there are only a few cases where one can obtain an exact solution, e.g., vacuum solutions (also known as gravitational waves), Schwarzschild metric (also known as the non-spinning black holes), Kerr metric (also known as the spinning black holes). 

\section{Linearised Einstein field equation}
For simplicity, let us first attempt to solve for the metric tensor when gravity is weak. We expand $g_{\mu\nu}$ as a sum of flat space metric and linear perturbation tensor $h_{\mu\nu}$ when the gravity is weak for some coordinate system,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:line_approx}
    g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu},~\text{for}~\left|h_{\mu\nu}\right| \ll 1.
\end{equation}
where $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric in the flat space also known as the Minkowski metric. 
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{\mu\nu} = \mathrm{diag}(-1, 1, 1, 1)
\end{equation}


Choosing a coordinate system to demand $\left|h_{\mu\nu}\right| \ll 1$ breaks the coordinate invariance of the theory, we address this issue later. Using linearised metric of Eq.~\eqref{eq:line_approx}, we linearise Eq.~\eqref{eq:einstein_tensor_ricci} to Eq.~\eqref{eq:christoffel_symbols}. Starting from the last equation, We linearize Christoffel symbols,
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \partial_\mu h^{\rho}_{\nu} + \partial_\nu h^{\rho}_{\mu} - \partial^{\rho} h_{\mu\nu} \right) + \mathcal{O}(h^2), \\
\end{equation}
then linearize Riemann tensor,
\begin{equation}
R_{~\rho \mu \nu}^\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{\rho \mu}^2 h_\nu^\lambda-\partial_\rho \partial_\nu h_\mu^\lambda+\partial^\lambda \partial_\nu h_{\rho \mu}-\partial^\lambda \partial_\mu h_{\rho \nu}\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(h^2\right),
\end{equation}
linearize Ricci tensor and scalar,
\begin{align}
R_{\mu \nu} &=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_\nu \partial_\lambda h_\mu^\lambda+\partial_\mu \partial_\lambda h_\nu^\lambda-\partial^\lambda \partial_\lambda h_{\mu \nu}-\partial_\mu \partial_\nu h_\lambda^\lambda\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(h^2\right), \\
R &= \frac{1}{2 }\left(\partial^\mu \partial^\nu h_{\mu \nu}-\partial^\mu \partial_\mu h_\nu^\nu\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(h^2\right),
\end{align} 
and finally linearize Einstein tensor,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:einstein_tensor}
G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_\lambda \partial_\mu h_\nu^\lambda+\partial_\lambda \partial_\nu h_\mu^\lambda-\partial_\mu \partial_\nu h-\square h_{\mu \nu}-\eta_{\mu \nu} \partial_\rho \partial_\lambda h^{\rho \lambda}+\eta_{\mu \nu} \square h\right).
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the trace of $h_{\mu\nu}$ and the $\square$ symbol represents $\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_{\mu\nu}$, also known as the d'Alembert operator or box operator. We introduce the trace-reversed $\bar{h}_{\mu\nu}=h_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2} \eta_{\mu \nu} h$ to simplify Eq.~\eqref{eq:einstein_tensor}.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:g_hbar}
G_{\mu \nu}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial^\lambda \partial_\nu \bar{h}_{\mu \lambda}+\partial^\lambda \partial_\mu \bar{h}_{\nu \lambda}-\square \bar{h}_{\mu \nu}-\eta_{\mu \nu} \partial^\lambda \partial^\rho \bar{h}_{\lambda \rho}\right)
\end{equation}
Since we made a choice for coordinate system in Eq.~\eqref{eq:line_approx}, the invariance of the theory is broken. We can partially restore this by choosing the harmonic gauge, 
\begin{equation}
\partial^{\nu}\bar{h}_{\mu\nu} = 0,
\end{equation}
for transformations 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:transform_vector}
    x^{\mu} \rightarrow x^{\mu} + \xi^{\mu}
\end{equation} where we need to ensure that $\left|\partial_{\nu}\xi_{\mu}\right|\lesssim\left|h_{\mu\nu}\right|$ so that perturbations are small. In harmonic gauge, Eq.\eqref{eq:g_hbar} further simplifies to,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:liner_last}
    G_{\mu \nu} = -\frac{1}{2}\square \bar{h}_{\mu \nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
the linearised field equation. 

\subsection{Solutions in vacuum}
Next, we attempt to solve the linearised field equations in vacuum. The stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ is equal to zero in this case. Therefore, Eq.~\eqref{eq:liner_last} reduces to 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:waveq}
    \Box \bar{h}_{\mu\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}
Eq.~\eqref{eq:waveq} is a wave equation as it admits plane-wave solutions, 
\begin{align}
    \bar{h}_{\mu\nu} &= A_{\mu\nu} \cos{\left(k_{\alpha}x^{\alpha}\right)}
\end{align}
which are the perturbation of a flat spacetime far away from the source or gravitational waves in vacuum. To satisfy the wave-equation, $k_{\alpha}k^{\alpha}$ should be equal to zero, meaning GWs in vacuum travel at the speed of light. The harmonic gauge ensures that 
\begin{equation}
    k^{\mu}A_{\mu\nu} = 0,
\end{equation}
so GWs are transverse, i.e., the polarization of the waves are perpendicular to the direction of propagation.  

\subsubsection{Plus and cross polarization}
Let us now count the degrees of freedom of the metric perturbation $\bar{h}_{\mu\nu}$. We start with 16 which which is the number of degrees of freedom of a $4\times4$ tensor. From 16, 6 are restricted due to $\bar{h}_{\mu\nu}$ being symmetric. From the remaining 10, 4 are restricted by harmonic gauge and 4 more are restricted by choosing $\square\xi_{\mu} = 0$ where $\xi_{\mu}$ is the vector field introduced Eq.~\eqref{eq:transform_vector}. Therefore, the metric perturbation in transverse-traceless (TT) gauge $\bar{h}^{\mathrm{TT}}_{\mu\nu}$ has 2 degrees of freedom, which are called the plus and cross polarizations, 
\begin{equation}
h^{\mathrm{TT}}_{\mu\nu} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & h_{+} & h_{\times} & 0 \\
0 & h_{\times} & -h_{+} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
for a gravitational wave propagating along in $z$-direction. The names follows from the phenomena that if a gravitational wave passes by ring of beads in vacuum, the plus (cross) polarization will periodically stretch and squeeze the ring in $+~(\times)$ shape. 

\subsection{Solutions far away from a source}
Moving on from the discussion on the vacuum solution, we now consider a scenario where the stress-energy tensor is non-zero,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:non_vacuum}
    \square \bar{h}_{\mu \nu} = -16\pi T_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Quadruple radiation}
Here, we can draw analogy from the calculation of electromagnetic radiation from arbitrary charge distribution at a distance. This calculation is usually done using multicol expansion. Each term in the series obtained from multipole expansion approximates the spatial distribution of the source and represents the contribution to far-field radiation in decreasing order. First term (also known as the monopole term) in the expansion is simply the total charge which does not contribute to the electromagnetic radiation due to law of conservation of electric charge. Therefore, the dominant contribution to the electromagnetic radiation is due to the dipole term.  

Similarly, before attempting to solve Eq.~\eqref{eq:non_vacuum}, we can argue that the gravitational radiation does not have a contribution from the monopole term due to law of conservation of mass. Unlike the electromagnetic radiation, the lowest order contribution to the gravitational radiation is the quadrupole term. The mass dipole term $(\approx \Sigma_i m_i\vec{x}_i)$ can be made zero by moving to the center of mass frame of the system. We cannot do the same in the case of electromagnetic radiation since charges (unlike mass) can be negative. 

Next, we write down the formal solution for Eq.~\eqref{eq:non_vacuum} using retarded Green's function. We impose boundary conditions such that there is no incoming radiation. Due to the far-field regime, our distance to the source $(\vec{x})$ is much larger then the length scale of the source $(d)$.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:green_eq}
    \bar{h}^{\mathrm{TT}}_{ij}(t, \vec{x}) =4 \Lambda_{i j k l} \int \mathrm{d}\vec{y} \frac{T^{k l}(t-|\vec{x}-\vec{y}|, \vec{y})}{|\vec{x}-\vec{y}|} .
\end{equation}
here $\vec{y}$ is contained within the source and $\Lambda_{ijkl}$ is the projection operator to TT gauge. Expanding the distance $|\vec{x}-\vec{y}|$ measurement,
\begin{equation}
    |\vec{x}-\vec{y}| = r - \vec{y}\cdot\hat{n} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{x}\right),
\end{equation} 
the reciprocal term $\frac{1}{|\vec{x}-\vec{y}|} \approx \frac{1}{r}$, and the stress-energy tensor expanded around $t-r$,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:multipole_exp}
    \begin{split}
        T^{k l}(t-r+\vec{y} \cdot \hat{n}, \vec{y}) \approx~T^{k l}(t-r, \vec{y})&+ (y^a n_a) \partial_0 T^{k l}(t-r, \vec{y}) \\
         &+\frac{1}{2} (y^a n_a) (y^b n_b) \partial_0 \partial_0 T^{k l}(t-r, \vec{y})+\ldots
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:multipole_exp}, the solution in Eq.~\eqref{eq:green_eq} to the leading order can be written down as,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:leading_ord}
\bar{h}^{\mathrm{TT}}_{ij}(t, \vec{x}) = \frac{4}{r} \Lambda_{i j k l} \int \mathrm{d}\vec{y}~T^{k l}(t-r, \vec{y}) 
\end{equation}
    %&= \frac{2}{r} \Lambda_{ijkl} \ddot{M}^{kl}(t-r)
The momenta $T^{kl}$ depend on the distribution of stresses inside the body which might be difficult to determine compared to the total mass of the body. Using the conservation of stress-energy tensor $(\partial_{\nu}T^{\mu\nu}=0)$ and the fact that the source is confined in space, we can express Eq.~\eqref{eq:leading_ord} in terms of the mass quadrupole moment~\cite{Maggiore:2007ulw},
\begin{equation}
    \bar{h}^{\mathrm{TT}}_{ij}(t, \vec{x}) = \frac{2}{r} \Lambda_{ijkl} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}{M}^{kl}(t-r),
\end{equation}
where $M^{kl} = \int \mathrm{d}\vec{y} T^{00} y^ky^l$ is the mass quadrupole moment. It shows the leading order contribution to the far-field gravitational radiation. The mass and liner momentum is conserved only in the case of linearized theory. A radiating body in fact loses mass and linear momentum. However, the absence of monopole and dipole term holds more generally. It can be derived in the full non-linear treatment of the field equation.

    \caption{Individual and combined antenna pattern functions of the Virgo detector over the whole sky at the time of arrival of GW170817 (blue marker). The dark (bright) color marks the regions of low (high) sensitivity.}
    \label{fig:antenna_pattern}
\end{figure}
Ground-based GW detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, work on the principles of interferometry. By observing the constructive and destructive interference of two laser beams, they can measure very small changes in length. The configuration of ground-based detectors is that of a modified Michaelson interferometer~\cite{LIGOScientific:2014pky}. 

\subsection{Current generation detectors}
A schematic diagram of an L-shaped interferometer is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:det_l}. A laser beam split into two travel through the two arms which are of equal length. The light bounces back from the mirror at the end of the arm. The laser travels equal distance in each arm in the absence of an external disturbances, e.g. abscence of a gravitational wave. When a gravitational wave passes by, it periodically stretches and squeezes the arms so the light no longer travels the same distance in both arms. By observing the constructive and destructive interference pattern in the light collect by the photo diode, we can measure the strain $(h(t))$ of the gravitational wave signal. The strain is equal to relative the change in arm length (L)
\begin{equation}
    h(t) =  \frac{\Delta L}{L},
\end{equation}

GW detectors are sensitive to the following linear combination of plus and cross polarization of a GW signal,
\begin{equation}
    h(t) =  \frac{\Delta L}{L} = F_+h_+(t) + F_{\times}h_{\times}(t).
\end{equation}

Here, $F_+$ and $F_{\times}$ are called antenna pattern functions of the detector. They enable the projection of the GW polarizations from source frame to the detector frame. Unlike the conventional electromagnetic telescopes, the GW detectors are not oriented in any certain direction. Their orientation changes only with the rotation of earth. Their sensitivity around the sky indeed depends on the sky-location of the source, polarization angle of the gravitational wave, and the arrival time of the signal at the detector. Each $F_i$ is a function of four parameters
\begin{equation}
    F_i := F_i(\alpha, \delta, \psi, t_c),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\delta$ denote the right ascension and declination, respectively. The polarization angle is denoted by $\psi$ and time of arrival by $t_c$. Their sensitivity is periodic over the duration of $\sim$24 hours. 

Figure~\ref{fig:antenna_pattern} shows the antenna pattern functions of the Virgo detector~\cite{VIRGO:2014yos}. We plot the $F_+$ and $F_{\times}$ over the whole sky by varying right ascension from $-180^\circ$ to $180^\circ$ and declination to $-90^\circ$ to $90^\circ$, at the time of arrival of the first gravitational wave signal detected from the merger of two neutron stars also known as GW170817~\cite{LIGOScientific:2017vwq}. We fix the polarization angle to the median value of its polarization angle of GW170817 while creating Figure~\ref{fig:antenna_pattern}.  

\subsection{Third generation detectors}
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{../figures/triangle_detector.pdf}
    \caption{A simple layout of the triangular design of Einstein Telescope. It consists of 3 V-shaped interferometers with an opening angle of 60 degrees, forming an equilateral triangle with arm-length of 10 km. The object notations are same as those shown in L-shpaed interferometer, namely M denotes the mirrors, B denotes the beam splitters, LS denotes the laser sources, and P denotes the photo diodes.}
    \label{fig:triangle}
\end{figure}
The two LIGO detectors~\cite{LIGOScientific:2014pky}, the Virgo detector~\cite{VIRGO:2014yos}, the KAGRA detector~\cite{Aso:2013eba}, and the upcoming LIGO detector in India~\cite{Saleem:2021iwi} are collectively refereed to as the current generation or second generation (2G) GW detectors. While the current generation GW detectors have opened a new window to observe the Universe, the proposed next generation also know as the third generation (3G) of GW detectors is expected to usher in an era of precision science. These include the Cosmic Explorer~\cite{Reitze:2019iox} and the Einstein Telescope (ET)~\cite{Punturo:2010zz, ET:2019dnz}. Design and site-selection studies to maximize the scientific potential of 3G detectors are currently underway. 

In particular, Figure~\ref{fig:triangle} shows a simple layout of the proposed triangular design of the Einstein Telescope. The Einstein Telescope is a network of three V shaped with an opening angle of 60 degrees, forming an equilateral triangle. The proposed arm-length is 10 km and the infrastructure is expected to be 250 to 300 meters below the ground. At the time of writing of this thesis, the proposed sites for the ET include the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) located near the border of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, the Sardinia island located in the south-west of Italy, and the Lusatia region in Saxony. Alternate proposals for the configuration of ET include, two distant L-shaped detectors (Figure~\ref{fig:det_l}) with 15 kilometer arm-length located in Sardinia and EMR region each~\cite{Branchesi:2023mws}.
