A GW signal emmited from merging binary black holes can be typically modelled using 15 parameters. Eight of them are considered intrinsic parameters. Two for the masses of each black holes and six describing the three dimensional spins. The rest of them, e.g. sky location, distance, arrival time of the GW signal, are considered extrinsic parameter. Measurement of these parameters is a key step that enables various physics insigts from the data.  In this chapter, the parameters of merging binary black holes and/or neutron stars are measured from a GW signal. 

Key ingredients: Waveform model, power spectral density, likelihood, sampling methods
