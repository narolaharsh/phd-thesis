A GW signal emmited during the merger two binary black holes can be typically modelled using 15 parameters. Eight of them are considered intrinsic parameters; two for the masses and six for three dimensional spins of two black holes. The rest of them, e.g. sky location, distance, arrival time of the GW signal, are considered extrinsic parameters. Measurement of these parameters is a key step which enables various physics related insigts from the data, e.g. testing the prediction of the general relativiy. In this chapter, we illustrate how the parameters of merging binary black holes and/or neutron stars are measured from a GW signal.
